# Goal:
# Build a machine learning model that predicts the cost of delivering
# bread orders based on features like distance, weight, etc.

# Step 1: Define the Problem & Plan
# Given order details (distance, weight, maybe delivery time, etc.), predict the delivery cost.

# Step 2: Create/Secure Data

# Step 3: Plan the ML Workflow
# Data Collection: Gather/generate data.
# Data Exploration: Visualize and understand.
# Data Cleaning/Preparation: Handle missing values, encode features.
# Model Building: Train/test a regression model.
# Model Evaluation: Check how well it works.
# Deployment: Build a simple API to serve predictions.
